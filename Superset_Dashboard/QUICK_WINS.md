# 🎯 Quick Wins - High-Value Charts to Implement First

Based on your NYC Taxi data, here are the **TOP 5 innovative charts** that provide immediate business value with minimal complexity.

---

## 1️⃣ Revenue Per Minute Analysis (HIGHEST VALUE)

**Business Value**: Shows drivers exactly where and when to maximize earnings per time invested.

**Why It's Better Than Standard Charts**: 
- Standard dashboards show total revenue (but busy zones might have long idle times)
- This shows **efficiency** - you could earn more in a "medium" zone with continuous pickups

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    z.Zone as location_name,
    z.Borough,
    CAST(SUBSTR(t.Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
    SUM(t.number) as total_trips,
    CAST(SUM(t.Total_Amount) / NULLIF(SUM(t.number), 0) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_fare,
    -- Assuming average trip is 20 minutes (adjust based on your data)
    CAST(SUM(t.Total_Amount) / NULLIF(SUM(t.number), 0) / 20.0 AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as revenue_per_minute
FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated t
LEFT JOIN taxi_zones z ON t.Pickup_Location = z.LocationID
WHERE t.Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
GROUP BY z.Zone, z.Borough, SUBSTR(t.Pickup_Time, 12, 2)
HAVING SUM(t.number) > 50
ORDER BY revenue_per_minute DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Chart Type**: Heatmap (Hour x Location, color intensity = revenue/min)

**Action**: Drivers can position themselves in high-efficiency zones during their shift.

---

## 2️⃣ Optimal 8-Hour Shift Analyzer (PRACTICAL VALUE)

**Business Value**: Tells drivers which 8-hour shift window maximizes earnings.

**Why It's Better**: 
- Not everyone works 9-5
- Different shifts have drastically different earning potential
- This analyzes ALL possible 8-hour windows

**SQL Query**:
```sql
WITH hourly_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        CAST(SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
        CAST(SUM(Total_Amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(Pickup_Time)) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as avg_daily_revenue,
        CAST(SUM(number) / COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(Pickup_Time)) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_daily_trips
    FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated
    WHERE Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2)
)
SELECT 
    CONCAT(LPAD(CAST(start_hour AS VARCHAR), 2, '0'), ':00 - ', 
           LPAD(CAST((start_hour + 8) % 24 AS VARCHAR), 2, '0'), ':00') as shift_window,
    start_hour,
    CAST(SUM(avg_daily_revenue) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as estimated_daily_revenue,
    CAST(SUM(avg_daily_trips) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as estimated_daily_trips,
    CAST(SUM(avg_daily_revenue) / 8.0 AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as revenue_per_hour
FROM (
    SELECT 
        h1.hour_of_day as start_hour,
        h2.avg_daily_revenue,
        h2.avg_daily_trips
    FROM hourly_revenue h1
    CROSS JOIN hourly_revenue h2
    WHERE h2.hour_of_day >= h1.hour_of_day 
        AND h2.hour_of_day < (h1.hour_of_day + 8)
        OR (h1.hour_of_day + 8 >= 24 AND h2.hour_of_day < ((h1.hour_of_day + 8) % 24))
) shifts
GROUP BY start_hour
ORDER BY estimated_daily_revenue DESC
```

**Chart Type**: Horizontal Bar Chart (Shift Window x Revenue)

**Action**: Clear recommendation for optimal working hours.

## 3️⃣ 80/20 Pareto Analysis (STRATEGIC INSIGHT)

**Business Value**: Shows if 20% of locations drive 80% of business (classic Pareto principle).

**Why It's Better**:
- Focuses strategic resource allocation
- Shows cumulative impact clearly
- Identifies where to concentrate marketing/driver positioning

**SQL Query**:
```sql
WITH location_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        t.Pickup_Location,
        z.Zone as location_name,
        z.Borough,
        SUM(t.number) as total_trips,
        CAST(SUM(t.Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as total_revenue
    FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated t
    LEFT JOIN taxi_zones z ON t.Pickup_Location = z.LocationID
    WHERE t.Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
    GROUP BY t.Pickup_Location, z.Zone, z.Borough
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT 
        location_name,
        Borough,
        total_trips,
        total_revenue,
        SUM(total_trips) OVER () as overall_trips,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_trips DESC) as rank,
        SUM(total_trips) OVER (ORDER BY total_trips DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as cumulative_trips
    FROM location_totals
)
SELECT 
    rank,
    location_name,
    Borough,
    total_trips,
    CAST(total_trips * 100.0 / overall_trips AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as pct_of_total,
    CAST(cumulative_trips * 100.0 / overall_trips AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as cumulative_pct,
    CASE 
        WHEN cumulative_trips * 100.0 / overall_trips <= 80 THEN 'Top 80%'
        ELSE 'Long Tail'
    END as category
FROM ranked
ORDER BY rank
LIMIT 100
```

**Chart Type**: Pareto Chart (Bar + Line) - Bars = trips, Line = cumulative %

**Action**: Focus on vital few high-impact zones.

## 4️⃣ Tip Yield Optimization Map (EARNINGS BOOST)

**Business Value**: Shows where/when customers tip best (as % of fare).

**Why It's Better**:
- Tips can be 15-25% of income
- Some zones/times have much better tipping behavior
- Actionable for maximizing take-home pay

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    z.Zone as location_name,
    z.Borough,
    CAST(SUBSTR(t.Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
    CASE 
        WHEN DAY_OF_WEEK(DATE(t.Pickup_Time)) IN (6, 7) THEN 'Weekend'
        ELSE 'Weekday'
    END as day_type,
    CAST(SUM(t.tip_amount) / NULLIF(SUM(t.Fare_Amount), 0) * 100 AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as avg_tip_percentage,
    CAST(SUM(t.tip_amount) / NULLIF(SUM(t.number), 0) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_tip_per_trip,
    SUM(t.number) as trip_count,
    CAST(SUM(t.Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as total_revenue
FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated t
LEFT JOIN taxi_zones z ON t.Pickup_Location = z.LocationID
WHERE t.Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
    AND t.Fare_Amount > 0
    AND z.Zone IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY z.Zone, z.Borough, SUBSTR(t.Pickup_Time, 12, 2),
    CASE 
        WHEN DAY_OF_WEEK(DATE(t.Pickup_Time)) IN (6, 7) THEN 'Weekend'
        ELSE 'Weekday'
    END
HAVING SUM(t.number) > 20
ORDER BY avg_tip_percentage DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Chart Type**: Bubble Chart (X=hour, Y=location, Size=trip_count, Color=tip_%)

**Action**: Position in high-tipping zones during premium hours.

## 5️⃣ Yellow vs Green Market Competition Map (STRATEGIC)

**Business Value**: Shows where the two taxi types compete and who dominates which zones.

**Why It's Better**:
- Standard charts show totals separately
- This shows competitive dynamics
- Reveals market opportunities (underserved zones)

**SQL Query**:
```sql
WITH taxi_comparison AS (
    SELECT 
        t.Pickup_Location,
        z.Zone as location_name,
        z.Borough,
        SUM(CASE WHEN t.taxi_type = 'yellow' THEN t.number ELSE 0 END) as yellow_trips,
        SUM(CASE WHEN t.taxi_type = 'green' THEN t.number ELSE 0 END) as green_trips,
        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN t.taxi_type = 'yellow' THEN t.Total_Amount ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as yellow_revenue,
        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN t.taxi_type = 'green' THEN t.Total_Amount ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as green_revenue
    FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated t
    LEFT JOIN taxi_zones z ON t.Pickup_Location = z.LocationID
    WHERE t.Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
        AND z.Zone IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY t.Pickup_Location, z.Zone, z.Borough
)
SELECT 
    location_name,
    Borough,
    yellow_trips,
    green_trips,
    yellow_trips + green_trips as total_trips,
    CAST(yellow_trips * 100.0 / NULLIF(yellow_trips + green_trips, 0) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as yellow_market_share,
    CAST(green_trips * 100.0 / NULLIF(yellow_trips + green_trips, 0) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as green_market_share,
    yellow_revenue,
    green_revenue,
    CASE 
        WHEN yellow_trips = 0 THEN 'Green Only'
        WHEN green_trips = 0 THEN 'Yellow Only'
        WHEN yellow_trips > green_trips * 3 THEN 'Yellow Dominated'
        WHEN green_trips > yellow_trips * 3 THEN 'Green Dominated'
        ELSE 'Competitive Zone'
    END as market_status
FROM taxi_comparison
WHERE yellow_trips + green_trips > 100  -- Significant zones only
ORDER BY total_trips DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Chart Type**: Scatter Plot (X=yellow_trips, Y=green_trips, Color=market_status, Size=total_revenue)

**Action**: 
- **For Yellow Operators**: Defend dominated zones, attack green zones
- **For Green Operators**: Find underserved opportunities
- **For Regulators**: Understand market balance

After implementing these charts, you should be able to answer:

1. **"Where should I position my taxi at 5 PM to maximize earnings per hour?"**
   → Revenue Per Minute + Tip Optimization

2. **"Should I work 6 AM-2 PM or 2 PM-10 PM shift?"**
   → Optimal Shift Analyzer

3. **"Are we over-serving some zones while ignoring others?"**
   → Pareto Analysis

4. **"Where can Green taxis expand without competing with Yellow?"**
   → Market Competition Map

5. **"Which hours/zones should I target for better tips?"**
   → Tip Yield Optimization

## 📝 Notes

- All queries assume your data is in `nyc_taxi_aggregated` table
- Adjust the 20-minute trip assumption in Query #1 based on your actual average
- For the shift analyzer, you might want to account for shift overlaps
- Tip data only includes credit card tips (cash tips not tracked)
- Consider adding filters for:
  - Weather conditions (if available)
  - Events (sports games, concerts)
  - Holidays
