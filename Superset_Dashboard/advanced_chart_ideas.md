**Insight**: Identify which hours and locations generate the most revenue per time unit, not just total revenue.

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    Pickup_Location,
    CAST(SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
    -- Assuming average trip takes 20 minutes (adjust based on your data)
    CAST(SUM(Total_Amount) / NULLIF(SUM(number), 0) / 20.0 AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as revenue_per_minute,
    SUM(number) as trip_count,
    CAST(AVG(AVG_Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_fare
FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated
WHERE Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
GROUP BY Pickup_Location, SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2)

## Behavioral Pattern Charts

### 17. Passenger Group Size Patterns
**Insight**: Do groups travel at specific times or from specific locations?

**SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    CAST(SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
    Pickup_Location,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 1 THEN 'Solo (1)'
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 2 THEN 'Couple (2)'
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 4 THEN 'Small Group (3-4)'
        ELSE 'Large Group (5+)'
    END as group_size,
    COUNT(*) as occurrence_count,
    CAST(AVG(AVG_Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_fare,
    CAST(AVG(AVG_Trip_Distance) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_distance
FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated
WHERE Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
    AND AVG_Passenger_Count > 0
GROUP BY SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2), Pickup_Location,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 1 THEN 'Solo (1)'
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 2 THEN 'Couple (2)'
        WHEN AVG_Passenger_Count <= 4 THEN 'Small Group (3-4)'
        ELSE 'Large Group (5+)'
    END
ORDER BY hour_of_day, occurrence_count DESC
```

    SELECT 
        CAST(SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
        CASE 
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 2 THEN 'Short (<2 mi)'
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 5 THEN 'Medium (2-5 mi)'
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 10 THEN 'Long (5-10 mi)'
            ELSE 'Very Long (10+ mi)'
        END as distance_category,
        SUM(number) as trip_count,
        CAST(AVG(AVG_Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_fare
    FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated
    WHERE Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
        AND AVG_Trip_Distance > 0
        AND AVG_Trip_Distance < 100
    GROUP BY SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2),
        CASE 
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 2 THEN 'Short (<2 mi)'
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 5 THEN 'Medium (2-5 mi)'
            WHEN AVG_Trip_Distance < 10 THEN 'Long (5-10 mi)'
            ELSE 'Very Long (10+ mi)'
        END
)
SELECT 
    hour_of_day,
    distance_category,
    trip_count,
    avg_fare,
    CAST(trip_count * 100.0 / SUM(trip_count) OVER (PARTITION BY hour_of_day) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as pct_of_hour
FROM distance_categories
ORDER BY hour_of_day, distance_category
```

**Chart Type**: 100% Stacked Bar Chart (Hour x Distance Category %)
**Value**: Understand trip purpose (short=local errands, long=airport/commute?)


### 19. Payment Method Correlation (if available)
**Insight**: Premium tip zones and payment preferences

**Note**: This requires payment_type data if available in your dataset

**Conceptual SQL**:
```sql
-- If you have payment_type column
SELECT 
    Pickup_Location,
    payment_type,
    COUNT(*) as trip_count,
    CAST(AVG(tip_amount) AS DECIMAL(8,2)) as avg_tip,
    CAST(AVG(tip_amount / NULLIF(Fare_Amount, 0) * 100) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) as avg_tip_pct
FROM raw_taxi_data  -- Your raw table
WHERE pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY Pickup_Location, payment_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
ORDER BY avg_tip_pct DESC
```

**Chart Type**: Grouped Bar Chart or Heatmap
**Value**: Credit card riders tip more (encourage card payments)

WITH metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        Pickup_Location,
        CAST(SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2) AS INTEGER) as hour_of_day,
        CAST(SUM(number) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as trips,
        CAST(AVG(AVG_Total_Amount) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as avg_fare,

        CAST(AVG(AVG_Passenger_Count) AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as avg_passengers,
        CAST(SUM(tip_amount) / NULLIF(SUM(Fare_Amount), 0) * 100 AS DECIMAL(12,2)) as tip_pct
    FROM nyc_taxi_aggregated
    WHERE Pickup_Time >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY, '%Y-%m-%d %H')
        AND Total_Trip_Distance > 0
    GROUP BY Pickup_Location, SUBSTR(Pickup_Time, 12, 2)
    HAVING SUM(number) > 10
)
SELECT 
    'Trips vs Fare' as metric_pair,
    CAST(CORR(trips, avg_fare) AS DECIMAL(5,3)) as correlation

4. **Time Series**: Add trendlines and moving averages
5. **Heatmaps**: Use perceptually uniform color scales
6. **Network Charts**: Limit to top N nodes for clarity

### Interactive Features to Enable:

- **Drill-down**: Click location â†’ see hourly breakdown
- **Cross-filtering**: Select hour â†’ update all charts
- **Tooltips**: Show detailed metrics on hover
- **Export**: Allow data download for further analysis
- **Alerts**: Set thresholds for automatic notifications
