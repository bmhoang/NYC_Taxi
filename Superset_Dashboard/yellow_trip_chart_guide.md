## ‚ùå Charts That DON'T WORK with Yellow Trip

### 1. **Top Pickup Locations by Zone Name**
```sql
-- ‚ùå CANNOT DO THIS - No LocationID
SELECT 
    Pickup_Location,  -- Doesn't exist!
    Zone,             -- Doesn't exist!
    COUNT(*) as trips
FROM nyc_yellowtrip
JOIN taxi_zones ON ... -- Can't join!
```
**Why it fails**: No `PULocationID` column
**Alternative**: Use coordinate-based map instead

---

### 2. **Borough-Level Analysis**
```sql
-- ‚ùå CANNOT DO THIS - No Borough reference
SELECT 
    Borough,  -- Can't determine from coordinates alone
    COUNT(*) as trips
FROM nyc_yellowtrip
```
**Why it fails**: Need complex geo-fencing to map coordinates to boroughs
**Alternative**: Manual coordinate range filtering (complex)

---

### 3. **Zone-to-Zone Trip Analysis**
```sql
-- ‚ùå CANNOT DO THIS - No LocationIDs
SELECT 
    pickup_zone,
    dropoff_zone,
    COUNT(*) as trips
FROM nyc_yellowtrip
```
**Why it fails**: No zone identifiers
**Alternative**: Coordinate-based clustering (advanced)

---

### 4. **Join with taxi_zones Table**
```sql
-- ‚ùå CANNOT DO THIS - No common key
SELECT 
    t.*,
    z.Zone,
    z.Borough
FROM nyc_yellowtrip t
JOIN taxi_zones z ON t.??? = z.LocationID  -- No match field!
```
**Why it fails**: Different data structure (coordinates vs IDs)
**Alternative**: Create spatial join (requires PostGIS or advanced GIS)

---

## üîÑ Workarounds for Missing LocationID

### Option 1: Simple Borough Classification (Approximate)
```sql
-- Rough Manhattan detection by coordinates
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN start_lat BETWEEN 40.70 AND 40.88 
         AND start_lon BETWEEN -74.02 AND -73.90 
            THEN 'Likely Manhattan'
        WHEN start_lat < 40.70 THEN 'Likely Brooklyn/Queens'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END as rough_area,
    COUNT(*) as trips,
    AVG(total_amt) as avg_fare
FROM nyc_yellowtrip
WHERE start_lat IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY rough_area;
```
**Chart Types**: Pie Chart, Bar Chart
**Accuracy**: ~70-80% (rough estimation)

---

### Option 2: Cluster Coordinates (Advanced)
```sql
-- Group similar coordinates
SELECT 
    ROUND(start_lat, 2) as lat_cluster,
    ROUND(start_lon, 2) as lon_cluster,
    COUNT(*) as trips,
    AVG(total_amt) as avg_fare
FROM nyc_yellowtrip
GROUP BY lat_cluster, lon_cluster
HAVING trips > 2;
```
**Chart Types**: Heatmap Grid
**Use Case**: Find hotspot clusters

## ‚úÖ Recommended Approach

### For Yellow Trip Data:

**DO Use For:**
- ‚úÖ Time-based analysis (all charts)
- ‚úÖ Financial metrics (all charts)
- ‚úÖ Trip characteristics (distance, duration)
- ‚úÖ Payment method analysis
- ‚úÖ Vendor comparison
- ‚úÖ Historical comparison (2009 baseline)

**DON'T Use For:**
- ‚ùå Zone-specific analysis (unless you add spatial processing)
- ‚ùå Borough-level insights (without geo-fencing)
- ‚ùå "Top Locations" tables with zone names

**Combine With Green Trip:**
- Historical evolution (2009 ‚Üí 2020)
- Payment method changes over time
- Fare inflation analysis
- Industry transformation (pre/post ride-share)

---

**Bottom Line**: Yellow Trip works for **~70% of standard charts** - all time-based, financial, and trip analysis charts work perfectly. Geographic analysis requires workarounds since it lacks LocationID.
